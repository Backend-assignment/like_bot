# Software Requirements Specification: Telegram Bot Like and Dislike Feature

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification for a like and dislike feature using inline buttons in the Telegram Bot API. This feature will allow users to express their appreciation for image messages sent in a Telegram chat, which will be recorded in a database. The system will be developed using the Telegram Bot API and the data will be stored in a database. The target audience for this feature is any Telegram user who wants to express their appreciation for an image message they received.

## Functional Requirements

### User Requirements

- The user can like an image message by clicking the "Like" inline button attached to the image.
- The user can dislike an image message by clicking the "Dislike" inline button attached to the image.
- The user can only like or dislike an image message once.
- The user will receive a confirmation message from the bot when they like or dislike an image message.

### Bot Requirements

- The bot will receive image messages from users and process them using the Telegram Bot API.
- The bot will attach inline buttons to the image messages, allowing users to like or dislike the image.
- The bot will update a database with information about the image messages that have been liked or disliked.
- The bot will send confirmation messages to users who have liked or disliked an image message.

### Database Requirements

- The database will store information about image messages that have been liked or disliked.
- The database will store the message ID, the user ID, and the action (like or dislike) for each image message.
- The database will prevent a user from liking or disliking an image message more than once.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- The system should respond to user actions within a reasonable amount of time (less than 2 seconds).
- The system should be able to handle a large number of user requests without slowing down.
Reliability
- The system should be available 24/7.
- The system should be able to recover from any failures, such as server downtime or database errors.

### Security

The system should prevent unauthorized access to the database.
The system should use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the user and the bot.

### Scalability

- The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users and image messages without affecting performance.

### Constraints

- The system must be developed using the Telegram Bot API and inline buttons.
- The system must only support image messages.
- The system must use a relational database to store information about liked and disliked image messages.
- The system must be developed using a programming language that supports HTTP/HTTPS requests.

## Conclusion

This Software Requirements Specification document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the constraints for the development of a like and dislike feature using inline buttons in the Telegram Bot API. The feature will allow users to like or dislike image messages, which will be recorded in a database. The system should be reliable, performant, secure, and scalable to handle an increasing number of users and image messages.
